It’s a race. Based on CMS’ PAT (peer-adjusted trend) Factor methodology, your rate of improvement must be better than your peers to achieve a bonus. #BPCI #BPCIA #ValueBasedCare https://t.co/rnvVPFjaja

Michael Reiche of @Steward on complementarity of BPCI Advanced and ACOs: for specialists in the ACO, many if not most of their patients were not attributed to the ACO. Bundled payments provide broader opportunities for specialists to take responsibility for non-ACO patients.
Michael Reiche of @Steward on the synergy of BPCI Advanced and ACOs: primary care physicians in ACOs are focused on reducing avoidable hospitalizations. But when hospital care is necessary, bundled payments will help us achieve better outcomes in spite of that acute exacerbation.
Our TOA resident representative, Jacob Murphree, introduced all of our concerns with BPCI Advanced and new inpatient regulations with his representative, Jodey Arrington from Lubbock. It was great witnessing our young leaders at #NOLC2018 https://t.co/fKCxEXmwAc
@ChrisGarciaRP on BPCI Advanced: For elective procedures, performance improves as you focuse on patient education, setting expectations for post-surgical recovery, and including patients in the decision process.
CMS signals the value-based payment train remains on track. 5 reasons you should participate in BPCI-A https://t.co/Oq1jmhzMVP
@ChrisGarciaRP on BPCI Advanced: you need real-time information to hold yourself and your partners accountable. You can't manage it if you can't see it. The question is *not* how did a facility perform last quarter; rather, how did that facility perform last *week*?
@ChrisGarciaRP on the technology that you need for BPCI Advanced: tools to identify the patients early in the hospital stay; tools to enable you to manage Clinical Episodes at scale and feed back the results (you can't wait for claims!)
@ChrisGarciaRP on BPCI Advanced: you need to have partners who are willing to improve along with you in the model and the technology resources to know where your patients are within the episode.
@ChrisGarciaRP on the keys to BPCI Advanced: (1) know your ecosystem when you are selecting Clinical Episodes; (2) understand who makes the decisions at the transitions of care; (3) build partnerships across the post-acute space.
