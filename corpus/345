@Travis_Broome If you maintain the current policy, it would be: "Exclude from BPCI Advanced only those ENHANCED patients subject to prospective assignment." It is not fair to BPCIA Participants to not know, until after the Year has ended, whether a particular beneficiary has been excluded.

A federal judge in Texas ruled the Affordable Care Act is unconstitutional, due to a recent change in federal tax law. The ruling has no immediate impact on #BPCIAdvanced or any other programs under ACA, including the insurance provisions. https://t.co/pipoQtglxM
