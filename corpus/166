How can physicians truly engage in #BPCI Advanced?

It’s imperative for physicians to include mid-level providers in the education &amp; training of their entire group - these providers are the ones doing most of the follow up #patientcare for the physician. https://t.co/oi39AWEA4D https://t.co/1E3inxgOdr
In BPCI-A, it's strange to me that CMS discounts the whole episode cost by 3%, not just the post-discharge part

Ex: a $20K episode- $15K DRG + $5K post-discharge

To beat Target Price you'd need to save more than the 3% Discount ($600), but that's 12% of the post-discharge spend

Or, conversely, if you're Lean already, perhaps no upside.  BPCI Advanced may offer more incentives, but also more requirements (have to stay in for a year, for example).
