@Health_Affairs @AmolNavathe @JoshuaLiaoMD @CMSinnovates ACOs need BPCI Advanced to engage meaningfully with specialists, since only a small minority of patients treated by the specialists are attributed to the ACO. 8/
@Health_Affairs @AmolNavathe @JoshuaLiaoMD @CMSinnovates And properly run BPCI Advanced programs, unlike many ACOs, have sufficient volume to meaningfully support system reform in hospitals and post-acute care facilities. 7/
@Health_Affairs @AmolNavathe @JoshuaLiaoMD @CMSinnovates Likewise, it would be inappropriate to punish the ACO where the BPCI Advanced provider is performing poorly -- and charging the ACO the actual cost of care instead of the target price. 4/
@Health_Affairs @AmolNavathe @JoshuaLiaoMD @CMSinnovates The target prices are a good proxy for the cost of care for these patients prior to intervention. If the BPCI Advanced principal accountable physician improves outcomes through their investments, it may be questionable to reward ACOs for the BPCI Advanced efforts. 3/
@Health_Affairs @AmolNavathe @JoshuaLiaoMD The assumptions of this article rest on the false belief that the BPCI Advanced target prices do not accurately reflect the average historical cost of the subset of patients seen by the physicians or hospital participating in model. 1/
