@afrakt @Michael_Chernew @NEJM Nice summary Austin; I would add that the new pricing for BPCI Advanced was not as generous in their efficiency adjustment, higher perfromers were not given much and effectively penalized, I predict fewer hospitals and groups and less success in BPCI-A than BPCI-C
@spiritus_bah @SVRaoMD Totally agree - had many conversations about this with the coding folks last time I was on service - coding guidelines don't match clinical ones! Lots of issues with claims data. Guessing/hoping @CMSinnovates has this on their radar for BPCI-Advanced.
Providers applying to the next round of #BPCIAdvanced will have a chance to do so in Spring 2019 to begin in 2020. https://t.co/VzuyNKT5cm https://t.co/HEc7LjUSXc
