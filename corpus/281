Our #BPCIAdvanced program has tripled since the first BPCI program and of those, 95% continued to advanced and those participants took a more robust involvement and expanded the program size by taking on more bundles. Learn more about the program: https://t.co/5Y7h06W7Nf
@BradleyFlansbau MS-DRGs 870-872 in BPCI Advanced. You are correct that coding norms for sepsis differ across hospital billing departments. MSSP Reconciliation includes the cost of claims associated with the BPCIA episode but not the NPRA (positive or negative).
BPCI-A question. Sepsis, a messy bundle beast (service/doc attribution/coding). How is it costed out if it exists within an ACO 1+? Is bundle episode "removed" from ACO spend trend? And can a provider own a sepsis bundle? Klunky DRG @nick_c_bluhm
