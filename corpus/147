With so much to take in, one post doesn’t do it justice. Here’s more on what’s changing: Unlike previous programs that calculated a target price based on the entire patient population (for a particular DRG), your BPCI-A target prices are assigned on a case-by-case basis.

While CMS will initially provide a “prospective” target price, this number is only preliminary and based on your historical case mix. Your ultimate target price will be retrospective and based on your actual case mix. Many providers will be flying blind during this period. #BPCIA https://t.co/BEy4N4M6WU
