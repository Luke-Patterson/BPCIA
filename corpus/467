I think this is the first detailed description of #BPCIAdvanced participants, certainly of physician groups. Nice 2 see greater diversity in participation - geographic and otherwise! (5/5).  @JoshuaLiaoMD @UPenn_MedEthics @PennLDI @PennCHIBE @AdamCMMi @CMSinnovates
Perhaps most importantly, new physician groups joining bundles via #BPCIAdvanced were larger and more internal medicine than those continuing from #BPCI. "New" hospitals were smaller and less likely to be teaching hospitals or urban. (4/5)
And the geographic spread is greater in #BPCIAdvanced compared to #BPCI (classic). (3/5) https://t.co/2M7TCq5R2N
80% of #BPCIAdvanced participants used convenors! (2/5) https://t.co/hLRdwbDSgv
