Thank you for joining our live coverage of the @CMSinnovates BPCI Advanced webinar!
@CMSinnovates is developing a tool for BPCI Advanced participants to access a list of beneficiaries prospectively-aligned to ACOs.
Participants in ACO models are able to apply for the BPCI Advanced model, which does not exclude these participants. Providers can be in both models but beneficiaries prospectively-aligned to MSSP Track 3 and Next Gen cannot initiate a BPCI Advanced episode.
The Participant is the risk-bearing entity under BPCI Advanced.
We will be one of the experts on this panel round table. Sign up to ask all the questions about #BPCIAdvanced https://t.co/OzPmgo02XL
In the BPCI Advanced Application, you must specify which types of NPRA Sharing Partners (but not the identities) you wish to partner with. Participants need to specify the individual NPRA Sharing Partners 60 days in advance of the start of the model.
Qualifying APM Participants who participate in Advanced APMs such BPCI Advanced will be exempt from the Merit-based Incentive Payment System.
@ahahospitals tells CMS lack of detail about #BPCIAdvanced is "making it difficult for hospitals and clinicians to make well-informed decisions as to participation."
