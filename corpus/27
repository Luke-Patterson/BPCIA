Good summary of new BPCI Advanced from @AmolNavathe. The most important point is the last one... https://t.co/aNFZHVGFCe
But with BPCI Advanced, these ACOs can capture value created at their hospitals (but not otherwise recognized under the ACO). The principal driver of savings under ACOs -- efficient use of post-acute care -- can originate from the investments justified by BPCI Advanced. 9/9
This model overlap policy is imperative to support ACOs struggling to engage with local specialists. BPCI Advanced can expand the breadth of population health organizations that sponsor them. 7/n
Second, with regard to model overlap and alignment, a majority of patients still have the opportunity to be in concurrent models. Most ACOs continue to participate in upside-only arrangements, which do not trump BPCI Advanced. 4/n
Overall, the article presented some of the notable merits of BPCI Advanced and identified at least one drawback: semi-annual reconciliations (there should be an option for quarterly). But some of the authors' criticisms deserve a retort.
