@rm_werner @AmolNavathe BPCI Advanced does not suffer from this mismatch between the service areas of the hospital and the ACO, allowing the sponsor of BPCI-A program to adequately recognize and reward hospital-based clinicians for the care redesign they implement (for BPCI Advanced and for ACOs). 7/7
@rm_werner @AmolNavathe BPCI Advanced could help ACOs justify investment in each hospital in order to better manage the spending in concentrated markets. Properly run BPCI Advanced programs have suff. volume to meaningfully support system reform in hospitals and post-acute care settings. 6/7
