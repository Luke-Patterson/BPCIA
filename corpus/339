@vampirelesbians @mtsw @MattBruenig I’m not discussing the merits of the policy, I’m just saying Title VII of the Affordable Care Act was so different from the rest that it got its own name (“BPCIA”) and now from Judge O’Connor’s opinion is evidently unseverable from the rest of the ACA
#BPCIAdvanced participants enrolled in eight clinical episodes each, on average. Learn more about early participants in a new @Health_Affairs blog post: https://t.co/jkRZEkAA69
There’s always a drug angle... BPCIA at stake here. Also Grassley’s beloved sunshine act and open payments database https://t.co/RI0s4u43KK
@jadler1969 The ruling appears broad enough to invalidate the BPCIA as well. No way it survives appeal.
For pharma folks, keep in mind that the BPCIA was part of the ACA. https://t.co/YVHMor6VrV
