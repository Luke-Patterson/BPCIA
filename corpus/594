@charles_gaba @ASlavitt this case itself utterly lacks merit : Congress declined to repeal the ACA; and replacing one tax level with another, even zero , cannot do indirectly what Congress refused to do directly - period. Especially the case where ‘victory’ unleashes consequences such as BPCIA repeal
